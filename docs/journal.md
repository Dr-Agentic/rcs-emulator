**Files modified**:
- `dashboard.js` - Updated suggestedActions example to GSMA UP format
- `script.js` - Fixed renderSuggestedActions and sendSuggestedAction functions
- `test_suggested_actions.json` - New test file with correct format

**Format Changes**:
**OLD (Incorrect) Format**:
```json
{
  "suggestedActions": [
    {
      "label": "ðŸ“± View Products",
      "action": "view_products"
    }
  ]
}
```

**NEW (GSMA UP Compliant) Format**:
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "action": {
        "text": "ðŸ“± View Products",
        "postbackData": "view_products"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**UI Rendering Updates**:
- `renderSuggestedActions()` now handles `displayText`, `text`, and `postbackData` fields
- Added `data-suggestion-type` and `data-postback` attributes for proper event handling
- Enhanced `sendSuggestedAction()` to distinguish between reply and action types
- Integrated with RCS event capture system for proper GSMA UP event generation

**Event Handling Improvements**:
- Suggested replies now generate `userMessage` events with text content
- Suggested actions now generate `suggestionResponse` events with postback data
- Proper source message ID tracking for event context
- Integration with existing RCS event capture system

**Design adopted**:
- **No backward compatibility**: Removed support for incorrect legacy format
- **GSMA UP compliance**: All examples now use proper suggestion structure
- **Proper field mapping**: UI renders using correct field names from parser
- **Event integration**: Button clicks properly trigger RCS event capture
- **Type distinction**: Proper handling of reply vs action suggestion types

**Difficulties encountered and solutions**:
1. **Field name mismatch**: UI expected `label`/`action` but parser returned `text`/`postbackData`
   - **Solution**: Updated UI rendering to use correct GSMA UP field names

2. **Event capture integration**: Needed to connect button clicks to RCS event system
   - **Solution**: Enhanced sendSuggestedAction to call appropriate event capture methods

3. **Legacy format removal**: Had to update examples without breaking existing functionality
   - **Solution**: Updated all examples to GSMA UP format and fixed rendering accordingly

4. **Source message tracking**: Needed to identify source message for event context
   - **Solution**: Added logic to find latest business message for sourceMessageId

**Testing performed**:
- Verified text and emojis now render correctly in suggested action buttons
- Confirmed GSMA UP format parsing works properly
- Tested event capture for both reply and action suggestion types
- Validated button click functionality with proper event generation
- Ensured no regression in other message types

**Result**: The "Text + Quick Actions" example now uses proper GSMA UP format, renders correctly with text and emojis visible, and generates appropriate RCS events when buttons are clicked. All legacy format support removed in favor of standards compliance.

## Button Interaction Implementation - August 27, 2025

**Feature**: GSMA UP Compliant Button Interaction Events

**Started**: August 27, 2025
**Finished**: August 27, 2025

**What was implemented**:
- Proper distinction between suggested replies and suggested actions
- GSMA UP compliant button interaction event handling
- Updated MessageFormatHandler to parse GSMA UP suggestion formats
- Separate event types for reply vs action interactions
- Enhanced event handlers to detect button types and generate appropriate events

**Files modified**:
- `rcs-events.js` - Added `captureSuggestedReply()` and updated `captureSuggestionResponse()`
- `MessageFormatHandler.js` - Updated suggestion parsing for GSMA UP format
- `rcs-event-handlers.js` - Enhanced button detection and event generation
- `docs/RCS_USER_INTERACTION_EVENTS.md` - Complete button interaction documentation

- **Rich Card Buttons â†’ suggestionResponse**: Card buttons treated as actions
- **GSMA UP format support**: Proper parsing of reply/action suggestion structures
- **Context preservation**: Maintains source message references and postback data

**Button Interaction Types**:
1. **Suggested Reply (Quick Reply)**:
   - Business sends: `{ "reply": { "text": "Yes", "postbackData": "yes_continue" } }`
   - User callback: `userMessage` with text content and reply context
   
2. **Suggested Action (URL/Dial/Generic)**:
   - Business sends: `{ "action": { "text": "Buy Now", "postbackData": "buy_now", "openUrlAction": {...} } }`
   - User callback: `suggestionResponse` with postback data and action URL
   
3. **Rich Card Buttons**:
   - Business sends: Rich card with embedded suggestions
   - User callback: `suggestionResponse` with card context

**Difficulties encountered and solutions**:
1. **Event type confusion**: Original spec showed wrong messageId for suggested replies
   - **Solution**: Clarified that suggested replies generate new userMessage with new messageId

2. **Reply vs Action distinction**: Needed to differentiate between reply and action buttons
   - **Solution**: Added `suggestionType` detection and separate handling methods

3. **GSMA UP format parsing**: Complex nested structure for suggestions
   - **Solution**: Enhanced parsing functions to handle reply/action structures properly

4. **Context preservation**: Maintaining source message references
   - **Solution**: Added `_replyContext` for replies and `sourceMessageId` for actions

5. **URL action handling**: Need to capture and forward action URLs
   - **Solution**: Added `actionUrl` field to suggestionResponse events

**Testing performed**:
- Verified suggested reply generates userMessage with correct text
- Confirmed suggested action generates suggestionResponse with postback data
- Tested rich card button interactions
- Validated GSMA UP format parsing for both reply and action types
- Ensured proper context preservation and source message references

**Result**: Button interactions now fully compliant with GSMA UP specifications, properly distinguishing between reply and action types, and providing comprehensive context for business logic processing.

## GSMA UP Compliance Fix - August 26, 2025

**Feature**: RCS Event Structure GSMA Universal Profile Compliance

**Started**: August 25, 2025 (initial RCS events implementation)
**Finished**: August 26, 2025 (Full GSMA UP compliance achieved)

**What was implemented**:
- Fixed RCS event structure to comply with GSMA Universal Profile specifications
- Updated event type names from custom format to GSMA standard
- Added required eventId field for deduplication and idempotency
- Changed userId to participantId as per GSMA UP requirements
- Corrected chat state values (composing/idle instead of started/stopped)
- Removed unnecessary messageType field from content structure
- Updated media message format to use proper GSMA content structure
- **ADDITIONAL FIXES (Round 2)**:
  - Changed action responses to use `suggestionResponse` event type (GSMA standard)
  - Split message receipts into separate `deliveryReceipt` and `readReceipt` events
  - Updated participantId to use MSISDN format (+15551234567) instead of free-form string
  - Marked rich card interactions as vendor extensions (not official GSMA UP)

**Files modified**:
- `rcs-events.js` - Core event capture service with full GSMA UP compliance
- `rcs-event-handlers.js` - Event handlers updated for suggestionResponse calls
- `docs/RCS_USER_INTERACTION_EVENTS.md` - Complete documentation rewrite for strict GSMA UP compliance

**Design adopted**:
- **GSMA Universal Profile compliant event structure** with all required fields
- **Unique event ID generation** for proper deduplication
- **MSISDN participant identification** using proper phone number format
- **Standard suggestion response events** instead of nested action content
- **Separate receipt event types** (deliveryReceipt, readReceipt) as per GSMA UP
- **Vendor extension marking** for non-standard rich card interactions
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for existing webhook integrations

**Difficulties encountered and solutions**:
1. **Action response format**: Initially used userMessage with nested action content
   - **Solution**: Implemented proper `suggestionResponse` event type as defined by GSMA UP

2. **Message receipt consolidation**: Used single event with status field
   - **Solution**: Split into separate `deliveryReceipt` and `readReceipt` event types

3. **Participant ID format**: Used free-form string instead of GSMA standard
   - **Solution**: Updated to MSISDN format (+15551234567) as required by GSMA UP

4. **Rich card interaction standardization**: Treated as official GSMA UP event
   - **Solution**: Marked as vendor extension with `_vendorExtension: true` flag

5. **Method name consistency**: Event handlers still called old method names
   - **Solution**: Updated all calls to use `captureSuggestionResponse` instead of `captureActionClick`

**Testing performed**:
- Verified all event types generate strict GSMA UP compliant JSON
- Confirmed eventId uniqueness across multiple events
- Tested chat state transitions (composing â†” idle)
- Validated content structure for text, media, and suggestion response messages
- Verified MSISDN format for participantId
- Tested separate delivery and read receipt events
- Ensured vendor extensions are properly marked

**Result**: RCS event system now **strictly compliant** with GSMA Universal Profile specifications, ensuring compatibility with all GSMA-certified RCS platforms and aggregators. Non-standard features are clearly marked as vendor extensions.
